Predicting Presence of Heart Disease using Machine Learning

Preventing Heart diseases has become more than necessary. Good data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases can improve the entire research and prevention process, making sure that more people can live healthy lives. This is where Machine Learning comes into play. Machine Learning helps in predicting the Heart diseases, and the predictions made are quite accurate. 

The project involved analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing. Here we have trained different Models using Naïve Bayes Algorithm.This is a Jupyter Notebook Code and we have taken dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains total 14 attributes.

Attributes are mentioned as follows:

P1 – Age P2 - Gender P3 – CP (chest pain) P4 - trestbps : resting blood pressure P5 – cholesterol P6 – fbs: fasting blood sugar> 120? Yes=1, no = 0 P7 – restecg: resting electrocardiographic results 0, 1, 2 P8 – thalach : maximum heart rate achieved P9 – exang : exercise induced angina (1= yes ; 0= no) P10 – oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest P11 – slope : the slope of the peak exercise ST segment P12 – ca: no. of major vessels (0 to 3) colored flurosopy P13 – thal :3 =normal ,6=fixed defect ,7= reversable defect P14 – diagnosis of heart disease
